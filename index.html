    "I want a million dollars" or "I want to live in a mansion"
    were the words of many people when asked what they hoped to
    achieve when they grow up. My career goals are to be content with my job while being able to balance it with my passions and
    have a good income while I am at it. I will find what I am 
    passionate about by taking different electives such as Spanish and computer science essentials in highschool 
    and staying open-minded to new sports or hobbies that might be incorperated with my job. So far, I want to become an engineer from home
    and a home cook.
    <br> <br>
    I have loved doing sports since I was a kid and the one that
    stuck with me until today is competitive taekwondo. I have done 
    taekwondo for ten years now and learned from the extremely difficult tests and over forty tournaments that
    it is all about discipline and ambition. In any career, 
    it is important to be consistent to get to the top and love your
    job because ambition beats talent in the long run, and that is what I have developed over the years.
    <br><br>
    In school, I have always been successful not just because of 
    straight A's in my classes, but also from other important accomplishments such as building 
    lifetime friendships, learning from mistakes, and taking healthy risks. 
    I have been through many challenges in life such as losing close people,
    getting severely injured in my sport, and underperforming when it simply wasn't my day. Despite any of this,
   I always came back stronger and improved for the next time. For example, there was a time in taekwondo when I 
   lost five tournaments back to back on the first match. For the next few years after that, I've been winning local events and competing on the national level too such as the 
   Taekwondo Grand Prix Finals.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, I am a passionate student ready to take on any 
    challenge thrown at me because of all my experiences and journeys. 
    Thank you for reading this resume about me and I hope that I encouraged
    you to check out the rest of my website with this background in mind!

    <p> Fun Facts: <br>
    I have been playing the piano for over 5 years. <br>
    I have done many sports in the past outside of school such as judo, soccer, Brazilian jujitsu, and taekwondo. <br>
    I have taken a Scratch coding class a few summers ago. <br>
    One of my favorite hobbies is going skiing.
